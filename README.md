# poke-draw
This is a small (and poorly written) javascript webapp to grab a random pokemon and countdown to display it! Its made mostly for me and my friends to challenge eachother to draw a pokemon within a limited amount of time

This is so disorganized im gonna clean up the commits and code soon
